# Create ai generated images of T-Shirts

<!-- reference a person with github account (https://github.com/shubham4315) -->

My friend [Nils](https://github.com/nilsertle) and I have created a website where you can create your own T-Shirt designs with the help of AI.

## Description
ðŸ‘• This project is an end-to-end website that allows users to create and order custom-designed t-shirts. ðŸŒŸ The platform features account creation functionality and a design tool that generates images from user prompts. ðŸ¤– The ordering process is fully automated, with API calls to Printful for printing and fulfillment, and payment processing is handled via the Stripe API. ðŸ”’ This project provides a secure and seamless user experience, enabling users to express their unique style through custom apparel. ðŸŽ¨

## How to use

1. Clone the repository
2. Replace the API keys in the `.env` file
3. Run `docker compose up` in the root directory
4. Open `localhost` in your browser

The application is build with [Api Platform](api-platform.com) and [React](https://react.dev/). We used tailwindcss for styling.
